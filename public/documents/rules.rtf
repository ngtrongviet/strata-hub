The registrar must refuse to deal with a matter if satisfied that mediation was appropriate and was not attempted. A person may either apply to the Secretary for mediation of a matter or make other arrangements for mediation. If mediation of a matter is unsuccessful or a matter is not appropriate for mediation, the registrar may accept the application for the order. The following table describes the types of orders that may be made and who may apply for them.\par}
